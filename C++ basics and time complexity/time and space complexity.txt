//time complexity: 
rate at which time taken increases with respect to input size

O() = O(total no. of steps in a code)

//tc calculation
-tc to be computed in terms of worst case scenario
-avoid constants
-avoid lower values

//Processes and their time complexities
-function call: O(1)
-for loop i= 0 to 10: O(1)
-single loop i = 0 to n: O(n)
-two nested loops from 0 to n: O(n^2)
-loop where i doubles each time: O(log n)
-recursive fn that splits input in half: O(nlogn)
-two separate non nested loops from 0 to n : O(n)
- k nested loops:O(n^k)
- recursive fn that make 2 recursive call for a problem of size n-1: O(2^n)
- generating all permutations of a set: O(n!)

// Space complexity
-auxiliary space -> space taken to solve a problem
-input space-> space taken to store input

-never do anything to input

//competitive programming
code ->server
1s = 10 to power 8 operations
2s = 2 * 10 to power 8 operations
5s = 5 * 10 to power 8 operations

time limit = 1s = O(10 to the power 8)
